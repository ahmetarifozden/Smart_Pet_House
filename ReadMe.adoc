= Project: Home Pet Project


== Step 1: Installation

  1. Get the Project from GitLab: https://gitlab.com/msaidbilgehan/home-pet-project

  2. Set the necessary hardware
    a. 1 Arduino UNO
    b. 1 Water Sensor
    c. 1 HX711 Weight Sensor
    d. 1 ESP8266 (ESP-01s) Wifi Module
    e. Optionally Bread Board for user friendly connection of hardware
    f. Necessary number of cables between Arduino pins, and other components


  3. Get library and Calibrate Weight Module with detailed in [here](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@drencolha/making-a-weight-scale-with-the-hx711-module-hx711-arduino-library-and-a-load-cell-tutorial) .

  3. Update the Wifi Module with detailed in [here](https://maker.robotistan.com/esp8266-ile-iot-dersleri-1-esp8266-modulunu-guncelleme/#Arduino-UNO-ESP8266-Baglantisi) .

  4. While uploading code in project, unconnect between Arduino and ESP Wifi Module's RX & TX connections.
      Otherwise Arduino IDE will give error because it's Serial Ports connected to ESP Module.
      After uploading code, you should connect ESP Wifi Module's RX & TX connections to Arduino.

  5. Upload .ino file to Arduino UNO

  6. Use!


== Step 3: Assemble the circuit

  CODE DEFAULT PIN CONFIGURATIONS
    // ==================
    // PIN CONFIGURATIONS
    // ==================

    WATER_SENSOR_PIN          A3                // Attach Water sensor to Arduino Analog pin 3 - A3
    WEIGHT_SENSOR_FIRST_PIN   A1                // Attach Weight sensor to Arduino Analog pin 1 - A1
    WEIGHT_SENSOR_SECOND_PIN  A0                // Attach Weight sensor to Arduino Analog pin 0 - A0

    ---

    Assemble the circuit following the diagram layout.png attached to the sketch


== Step 4: Load the code

    Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board

=== Some Tips

  When Serial Monitor activated, and preprocessor variable "IS_WEIGHT_CALIBRATIN_ACTIVATED" is true weight sensor calibration option will be available with basic usage below;
    1) Please remove all weight from scale
    2) Place known weights on scale one by one
      Press 'w' to increase calibration factor by 25
      Press 's' to decrease calibration factor by 25
      Press 'e' to increase calibration factor by 250
      Press 'd' to decrease calibration factor by 250
      Press 't' for tare (to set scale zero which is no weight base)
      Press 'd' for change calibration factor to default
      Press 'q' for tare and finish the calibration

  Also, more information will be printed for user-friendly design
